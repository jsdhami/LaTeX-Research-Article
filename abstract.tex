This research examines electrical and optical properties of atmospheric pressure circular dielectric barrier discharge (APCDBD) in natural air. Airflow and input voltage effects on power consumption are studied. The discharge energy and power per cycle are derived from Lissajous plots and voltage-current curves. Light emissions during plasma discharge determine electron excitation, rotational, and vibrational temperatures, and plasma density. The Boltzmann plot technique estimates electron excitation temperature, while MassiveOES software calculates rotational and vibrational temperatures. Results show increased filamentary microdischarges with rising airflow and voltage. \\
